= Strasser's Resignation

Arguably the second most powerful man in the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, just behind [+ nsdap_leader +] himself, Gregor Strasser, has resigned from his party posts! As head of the party organization and standard-bearer of its "left wing", Strasser had built a reputation as a sober and pragmatic counterbalance in a movement otherwise dominated by fanatics. 

A realist, Strasser believed the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> could not win a majority at the ballot box and should have participated in the Papen cabinet when their bargaining power was strongest. His deep understanding of the grassroots conditions had led him to predict that another election would devastate the party’s support and morale, ultimately drying up their funding.

Disillusionment with [+ nsdap_leader +]’s rigid, all-or-nothing strategy had been building for months. Strasser was reportedly authorized to negotiate the final terms of a deal for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> participation in a Schleicher-led cabinet. Yet, at the last moment, [+ nsdap_leader +] reversed himself—abruptly rejecting the plan under influence from Goebbels and Göring during a party leadership meeting.

For Strasser, this last-minute betrayal was the breaking point. He openly criticized [+ nsdap_leader +]’s indecisiveness, declaring that he would even support a violent seizure of power—if a clear order were given. The final straw came when [+ nsdap_leader +] publicly addressed the party’s parliamentary delegation, proclaiming: “A great movement has never triumphed by taking the path of compromise”.

title: Is this part of a Schleicher-Strasser conspiracy?
subtitle: Rumor has it that the chancellor is planning a *Querfront*, and Strasserist split in the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> is just the beginning.
on-arrival: nazi_peak_triggered = 1 if not hitler_mode; nazi_peak_votes = nsdap_votes  if not hitler_mode; nazi_decay_timer = 24 if not hitler_mode; coup_progress += 4; workers_nsdap -= 2; unemployed_nsdap -= 2; nazi_explode += 1

However, nothing ever happens. After sending a letter to [+ nsdap_leader +] explaining his reasons for resigning, Strasser quietly departs on a two-week vacation to northern Italy. In a letter, he assures [+ nsdap_leader +] that he has no intention of becoming "the focal point of oppositional efforts or even of discussions thereof." Strasser is not a fighter like his brother; he has squandered his chance to trigger a meaningful defection—potentially involving sixty Reichstag deputies.

This was not part of any grand plan by Schleicher to split the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>. In fact, the loss of his closest potential "ally" within the party has effectively ended Schleicher’s hopes of using his influence to convince the broader party to tolerate his government.

For the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, losing their most effective organizational leader is a serious blow. Across Germany, a growing sense emerges: the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have peaked, and their internal contradictions will soon begin pitting the movement against itself. However, Hitler’s threat of suicide, his impassioned pleas, and his charismatic presence have so far held the party together—preventing others from following Strasser’s lead, at least for now. Publicly, Hitler claims that Strasser has merely requested sick leave, softening the immediate impact.

# not immediate support loss, since strasser and nsdap didnt make a big deal over it to the public
